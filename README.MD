Building chell was such a fun project—it’s like a mini coding playground right in your browser 🎮. My goal? Let devs test JavaScript ideas fast, no clunky setup or file-saving drama. Why jump through hoops when you can just… code and see what happens?

The heart of it is CodeMirror—a slick editor that handles JS, HTML, and CSS outta the box. I added auto-closing brackets (no more stressing over syntax) and the Dracula theme for that moody, dev-friendly look. Fira Code font? A smart move for readability, with ligatures that make code flow better.

Styling was all about clean, minimal vibes 🖌️—think tokyo-night but lighter. Used CSS variables so theming stays easy later (dark/light mode? Let’s go). Also made sure it works on phones—viewport tags dialed in so no one’s squinting at tiny screens.

There’s a lil’ Google Gemini helper built in—optional, but handy if you’re curious about something while coding. Not a must-have, but a nice touch for quick answers without tab overload.

The browser itself is wild 🤯. It’s not just a viewer anymore—it’s an IDE, terminal, and a research buddy? Watching code run live? Super satisfying. Instant feedback = better learning and faster prototyping.

Honestly, chell grew more from curiosity than a strict plan. Played with plugins, tweaked themes, and kept iterating. It’s not about being perfect—it’s about hacking around, breaking stuff, and learning as you go.

In the end, it’s a project I’m proud of. It’s not just a tool—it’s a reminder that coding can be fun, flexible, and totally worth the nerdy deep dive 🧠✨.
